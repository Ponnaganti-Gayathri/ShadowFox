# Full-Stack Client-Server Application (Project Phoenix)

This is a full-stack web application developed as a client project during the ShadowFox internship. It features a complete architecture with a separate front-end client and a back-end server, demonstrating the ability to build and manage a complex, end-to-end software solution.

**Note:** To uphold the utmost confidentiality of the company, the specific business logic and features of this client project are not detailed in this public README.

### Key Features & Architecture
- **Decoupled Structure:** The project is built with a modern architecture, separating the front-end (`client/`) from the back-end (`server/`) to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- **Data Security Focus:** A key priority was ensuring data security and integrity throughout the application, following best practices for handling sensitive information.

### Technology Stack
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Collaboration:** Professional workflow standards were followed, with project discussions managed through dedicated meetings.
