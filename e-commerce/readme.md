# E-commerce Website Enhancement

This project focuses on enhancing the user experience (UX) of an existing e-commerce website by implementing advanced features for product discovery and interaction.

---

### Key Enhancements Implemented
- **Advanced Product Filtering:** Users can filter products based on various criteria (e.g., category, price range) to easily find what they are looking for.
- **Dynamic Sorting Mechanisms:** Products can be sorted by price, popularity, or name, providing users with greater control over their browsing experience.
- **Streamlined User Interface:** The design was improved to be more intuitive, visually appealing, and to simplify the path from product discovery to checkout.
